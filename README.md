## UNDERSTANDING THE AUSTIN HOUSING MARKET BY LOOKING AT NEW HOUSING SUPPLY

There are a nearly infinite variety of factors that influence pricing in any housing market, but to simplify things for easier comprehension, it can be helpful to summarize those factors into the categories of supply and demand. If a giant, foreign investment company collapses and liquidates assets in the region, you can just think of it as a bump in supply. If the region is trending as the "Best Place to Move" by influencers and landed major tech company relocations, these are just examples of increases in demand. The most common way to measure the demand in an area is with changes in home pricing. When demand goes up, buyers compete with higher prices. But these forces dont play out in isolation, and as prices rise the incentive for builders and investors to create new housing rises. So another great metric to look at to understand the demand in a housing market is the amount of new construction happening. 

Austin has a great [data set](https://data.austintexas.gov/Building-and-Development/Issued-Construction-Permits/3syk-w9eu) containing all of the city's building permits since about 1980, and using this data we can create a chart that shows the demand for new construction over time.

The above chart is a way of representing the demand for housing in Austin. Now it is easy to see that there was a lot of demand for housing in 1983, and very little demand for housing in 1990. But to have context to understand the relative value of the demand we need to illustrate the supply. Below, I use the same dataset but instead of housing units permitted, I use the number of housing units that are built and arrive to the market for each year.

Although these measures seem very similar, they can be quite different because of the time it takes to build housing units to fulfill the demand. These measures would be identical if housing could be built instantly, but some large, multi-unit buildings can take 3+ years to arrive to market and a lot can change in that time. Below are the supply and demand values plotted as lines. Notice how the peaks and valleys of the supply line are similar to the demand peaks and valleys, but offset by about a year or two.

Also notice how the lines cross back and forth, years where the orange line is on top means that more housing units were demanded than were able to be produced, and years when the blue line is on top means that more housing units were built than new units were demanded. In this instance, we know that the demand is causal because a permit getting issued causes a unit to be built, and a unit can NOT be built unless a permit is issued first. If we frame this graph in terms of the difference between demand and supply we can see the number of "unbuilt" houses per year. Think of this yearly "unbuilt" as the annual housing supply "deficit" and this deficit can be positive or negative. In years where the orange line is on top there is a positive housing deficit that adds to the cumulative total of housing units that are permitted but not built, and years where the blue line is on top the deficit is negative and reduces the running total number of unbuilt housing units. While the deficit can be positive or negative on a given year, the running total or housing unit "debt" can only go as low as zero, since a negative number would mean that more housing units have been built than have been permitted overall.

This graph is pretty hard to make sense of by itself, but what we can see is that what goes up seems to come back down. Why is this? Simply put: overbuilding. There is a positive feedback loop where when supply becomes low, demand will be relatively higher raising prices and incentivizing new construction until the supply becomes high enough to cause prices to drop and building to slow. But because some large buildings can take years to complete, the demand will often be satisfied before the market can send the signal to builders to stop building. The result is overbuilding, there is more housing supply than the market demands. Notice here how the level of building seems to correspond to the level of deficit that follows. 

But the market does not work well if it is too "tight", having a little bit of excess housing in the market allows for new people to enter the market and for people to have options when they decide to move. Below we take a look at the Austin housing market in terms of cumulative deficit, or housing supply "debt" for each year.
